Final Project Purpose Statement
Personal Finance Tracker: 
Managing personal finances can be challenging especially when tracking multiple income and expense transactions. Many people find it hard to keep an organized record of their finances. To address this issue, I propose to develop a Personal Finance Tracker console application in Python. This program will allow users to: 
* Record Transaction (income and expense)
* View a list of all transactions with details like date, type, description and amount. 
* Edit or delete transactions.
* Categorize transactions for better tracking. 
The application will store data in an SQLite database and users will interact with it through a simple menu interface. 
The purpose of the Personal Finance Tracker program is a simple console application that enables users to record and review their financial transactions so they can stay organized and manage their money effectively.
